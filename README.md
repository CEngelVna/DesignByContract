Design by Contract in ABAP

Please have a read of this blog:

https://blogs.sap.com/2012/09/07/design-by-contract-in-abap/

The idea is to replicate the "Design By Contract" concept from EIFFEL inside ABAP

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract

This repository has a dependency on the ABAP Open Source Logger, but this repository contains a marker interface so hopefully APACK will take care of this dependencey when downloading the code via abapGit

Naturally if you have any changes or improvements you would like to make please let me know.
